          <p>
            I'm currently studying at the University of Kent, in my second year.
            Currently, I'm mainly focused in Web Development, Computer Systems,
            AI, Correctness and Efficiency of Algorithms. I'm a dedicated ringer,
            of 15 years, and an avid tennis player. I've had a passion for
            technology since I was young, and have funneled that into my studies
            and spare time.
          </p>
